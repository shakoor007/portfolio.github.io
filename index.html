                    <p>Hello, my name is Anas Shakoor. I am a first year student in Dalhousie University studying Bachelors in Applied Computer Science. I moved to Canada in 2019 and have been in Halifax since. As a child, I have always been fascinated with computers, and my interest has always been with technology, which is why I chose computer science in university. I aspire to become a machine learning engineer and hope to gain valuable experience in university which I can bring forth to the company, and I aim to show you my potential and experience in the work field in my website.</p>
